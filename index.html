<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>
I am a freelance technical journalist whose work appears both in print and online, and covers a wide range of subjects across the technical field. I have written for Hackaday, Hackspace magazine, MagPi magazine, Practical Wireless, and while working for the Oxford Dictionaries before Language Spy existed, for their OxfordWords Blog.
</p>
<p>
I am one of several contributing editors working for <a href="https://hackaday.com/author/jennylist/">Hackaday.com</a>.
</p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>
I am a freelance electonic engineer whose work has fallen mainly in analogue projects in both the audio and RF domains.
</p>
<p>
In the past I have produced a range of amateur radio kits for the Raspberry Pi single board computer. This business is currently on hiatus due to personal reasons.
</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>
I have produced software professionally ove three decades, in everything from perl and classic ASP in the 1990s to Python and C for microcontrollers in the present.
</p>
<p>
In particular I have done a lot of work in the field of language analysis.
</p>
<h2>Hackerspaces</h2>
<p>I am an active participant in my local hackerspace communities, have been a hackerspace director, and have written extensively on the subject of hackerspace governance.</p>
